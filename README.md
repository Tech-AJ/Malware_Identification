# Malware_Identification

Binary classification is performed to classify a file as Malware or not.

Dynamic Analysis-
Json reports extracted by running programs in cuckoo environment is provided.
1) DataExtraction is performed on json files based on prior knowledge of how Malware behaves when run.
    This includes exploring DllLoaded, Summary, ApiStats, Severity, NetworkCalls made by the program when run.
2) Feature Selection is further performed on the extracted data using FeatureSelector tool.
3) RandomForestClassifier is used for classification. GridSearch is used for tuning the hyper-parameters.
4) Model Predicts with 99.8% accuracy.

Static Analysis
Static Analysis Text reports comprising of opcodes, structures ans strings which are generated 
without running the program for each program is provided.
1) Data extraction is performed on text files provided based on prior knowledge.
2) RandomForestClassifier is used for classification. GridSearch is used for tuning the hyper-parameters.
4) Model Predicts with 95.5% accuracy.


Conclusion -
Static analysis can only provide atmost ~96% accuracy as some harmful behaviour found in Malware
can only be observed by running the files.
Thus Dynamic Analysis is performed which gives 99.8 % accuracy.

Scored 100/100 in this mid-term exam.
