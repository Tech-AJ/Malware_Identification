To run the model for prediction
On terminal do-
 make f="full path to a directory containing static analysis information"
 or
 (without using makefile)-
 python dynamic.py "full path to a directory containing static analysis information"

 If any error occurs try using python3 explicitly in command
 python3 dynamic.py "full path to a directory containing static analysis information"

To run static.py successfully, following imports are required-
    import csv
    import json
    import os
    import sys
    import numpy as np
    import pickle


Folder structure is as follows -
dynamicTrain.csv - output csv file created after running dataExtractionScript.py
prediction.py- required script that takes absolute path as input and generates dynamic.csv as output after predictioon in current folder.
modelDynamic.py - to makemodel "model.sav" and apply Kfold to it
model.sav - model generated
dataExtractionScript.py -  to do feature extraction and store it as .csv file
dynamicTrain.csv - featues after feature extraction and selection.
