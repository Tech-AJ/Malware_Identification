To run the model for prediction
On terminal do-
 make f="full path to a directory containing static analysis information"
 or
 (without using makefile)-
 python static.py "full path to a directory containing static analysis information"

 If any error occurs try using python3 explicitly in command
 python3 static.py "full path to a directory containing static analysis information"

To run static.py successfully, following imports are required-
    import csv
    import os
    import sys
    import pickle
    import numpy as np

Folder structure is as follows -
modelStatic.py - to makemodel "modelStaic.sav" and apply Kfold to it
modelStatic.sv - model generated
scriptStatic.py- to do feature extraction and store it as .csv file
static.csv - output csv file created after running static.py
dataExtractionScript.py - required script that takes absolute path as input and generates static.csv as output in current folder.
staticTrain.csv - featues after feature extraction and selection.

NOTE: 
In static.py file, while reading a txt file, I am not using any encoding(like utf8 or latin1) explicitly as I was not getting any error on my system. But some students were getting those error(discussed on canvas).
If at evaluation runtime - the code gives any encoding error - we might have to change this line -

                with open(os.path.join(root, file)) as f:

to use some encoding based on the input provided/ system used.
